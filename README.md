# code
This code estimates the strength of an input password with the help of an entropy-based algorithm.
The JavaScript file includes the implementation of Regular Expression in JavsScript to check the metrics required for a strong password. The password strength is calculated on a score basis which decides whether the password is weak, average, or strong.
The JavaScript code is stored in an external Script file and integrated into the HTML file and hence, a webpage is developed.
CSS is used to style the layout of the webpage.
